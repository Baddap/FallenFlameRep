[MidRight]#Wren
This spot should be good to spar in,[N]
ready Wigbrand?[A]

[MidLeft]#Wigbrand
Poised as ever Lady Wren. Steel your[N]
blade and strike just as a Blumari[A][N]
Kingdom knight should![A]

[MidRight]#Wren
Phew... you took the air out of me[N]
there... Well... good enough for the[A][N]
frontlines now?[A]

[MidLeft]#Wigbrand
A distinct improvement from our last[N]
session. But being ready for the[A][N]
frontlines comes down to more than just[N]
being able to fight toe to toe with[A][N]
trained knights, when the enemy is out[N]
for blood and death is abound on the[A][N]
battlefield, it's a completely different[N]
story. Understood?[A]

[MidRight]#Wren
Mhmm, but I've bore witness to such[N]
things whenever you and father have[A][N]
taken me to battles. I might not have[N]
taken a life myself yet but I understand[A][N]
what's at stake.[A]

[MidLeft]#Wigbrand
I suppose so, your father and I have[N]
never been ones to hide the truth of[A][N]
war from you. Maybe you're ready after[N]
all. I'm confident in your knowledge of[A][N]
tactical theory but the only way to[N]
test your leadership abilities is to[A][N]
eventually put you through the wringer[N]
of an actual battle one day.[A]

[MidRight]#Wren
That could be soon even. I've heard [N]
from uncle that Hawkport has been[A][N]
barraged by a constant slew of[N]
Gofuallian pirates on the east.[A][N]
Supposedly they've formed a[N]
confederation to help organise an[A][N]
invasion force heading here for[N]
mainland Blumari.[A]

[MidLeft]#Wigbrand
I wouldn't put too much stock in it, it[N]
would take a mighty fierce leader to[A][N]
unite such a rabble. Perhaps your uncle[N]
is overestimating the threat, he's been[A][N]
thrown into the role of governor for[N]
the Hawkport colony suddenly by your[A][N]
grandfather, Duke Falcone in your[N]
father's abscence, he lacks experience.[A][N]
Granted, no one else would be a fit to[N]
take over from your father, wherever[A][N]
he is...[A]

[MidLeft][LoadShamira]
[Left][LoadOrvar]

[MidLeft]#Shamira
Lady Wren! While scouting the area with[N]
Huginn we saw the approach of bandits[A][N]
heading this way! If Orvar hadn't been[N]
out in the woods gathering mushrooms[A][N]
perhaps we'd be able to retrieve my[N]
father's gift to Duke Falcone before[A][N]
they arrived.[A]

[Left]#Orvar
I wasn't looking for mushrooms! I was[N]
actually the only one who thought to[A][N]
scout in the woods you know, bandits[N]
could be anywhere! Although these[A][N]
mushrooms I'm holding right now were[N]
just a lucky chance encounter.[A]
[MidLeft][Clear]
[MidLeft][LoadHuginn]

[MidLeft]#Huginn
Save it for later Orvar,[N]
we've got bandits to bash.[A]
[Left][ClearFace]

[MidRight][LoadWigbrand]

[MidRight]#Wigbrand
Aptly put as ever Huginn, seems like[N]
you'll be getting that valuable[A][N]
learning experience much earlier than[N]
anticipated, Lady Wren.[A]

[Right]#Wren
Aye, let's get to it then![A]
[X]

## PrologueReinforcementText

[MidLeft][LoadDatta]
Looks like there's a bunch of sword[N]
sword amongst that crowd of knights...[A][N]
No worry, back-up should be coming soon[N]
our sellsword will cut them deep![A][N]
[X]

## PrologueClosingText

[MidRight][LoadWren]
[MidLeft][LoadWigbrand]

[MidRight]#Wren
The commander has fallen and whatever's[N]
left has scattered. Do we pursue?[A]

[MidLeft]#Wigbrand
They've all gone their own ways, a[N]
lonesome crook is of no concern for us.[A][N]
Although I couldn't help but notice the[N]
unusual Gofaullian accent on the leader.[A][N]
Would you have any idea where they hail[N]
from Huginn?[A]

[Right][LoadHuginn]

[Right]#Huginn
Sounded like one from the east coast.[N]
I'd reckon he's from the confederate,[A][N]
not a Blumari bandit like the others.[A]

[MidLeft]#Wigbrand
It may very well be the case then that[N]
they have swarmed the rest of the[A][N]
mainland, colluding with bandits from[N]
Blumari to wreck havoc, prepare[A][N]
yourselves for more combat everyone.[A]

[MidRight]#Wren
We'll march home as swiftly as we can[N]
then. If the pirates and bandits are[A][N]
working together already then perhaps[N]
my father's prediction about the[A][N]
invasion was a good guess.[A]

[MidLeft]#Wigbrand
Best be ready to fight all manner of[N]
enemies then, knights and knaves alike.[A][N]

[MidRight]#Wren
Indeed, it's quite the unusual colation[N]
isn't it? Let's march on then and see[A][N]
for ourselves what their combined[N]
strength can do compared to our own.[A]

## PrologueHuginnWrenTalk

[Right][LoadWren]
[Left][LoadHuginn]

[Right]#Wren
Huginn, mind if I ask how your family[N]
fares in Gofaul? I heard fighting has[A][N]
been intense in the country on the[N]
colony frontier where they live.[A]

[Left]#Huginn
They don't live there no more. Muninn[N]
set up a blacksmith's in the capital[A][N]
with the gold from my mercenary work.[N]
Family moved with him so they're fine.[A][N]
Harvest wasn't any good so they had to[N]
give up on the farm.[A]

[Right]#Wren
Mhmm, I've heard this summer has been[N]
unusually wet, with plenty of flooding.[A]

[Left]#Huginn
It's the war. The titan spirits can't[N]
nurture the land if men are spilling[A][N]
blood between each other instead of[N]
the usual animal sacrifices.[A]

[Right]#Wren
I think it's just the changing weather.[N]
That's all. But then again, I'm not a[A][N]
pagan like other Gofaullians.[A]

[Left]#Huginn
Other Gofaullians? Aren't you from[N]
Blumari?[A]

[Right]#Wren
I am, but my mother is Gofaullian. So[N]
I'm half Gofaullian.[A]

[Left]#Huginn
This is news to me. Sir Kestral married[N]
a Gofaullian?[A]

[Right]#Wren
For anyone who knew him when he was[N]
younger it's no surprise I guess. But[A][N]
father is very different now.[A]

[Left]#Huginn
Hmm. Well, alright then.[A]
[X]
