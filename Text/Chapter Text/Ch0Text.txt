[MidRight][LoadWren]
[MidLeft][LoadWigbrand]

[MidRight]#Wren
This spot should be good to spar in, ready[N]
Wigbrand?[A]

[MidLeft]#Wigbrand
Poised as ever Lady Wren. Steel your blade and[N]
strike just as a Blumari Kingdom knight should![A]
[X]

## PrologueOpeningText2

[MidRight]#Wren
Phew... you took the air out of me there...[N]
Well... good enough for the frontlines now?[A]

[MidLeft]#Wigbrand
A distinct improvement from our last session.[N]
But being ready for the frontlines comes down[A][N]
to more than just being able to fight toe to toe[N]
with trained knights, when the enemy is out for[A][N]
blood and death is abound on the battlefield,[N]
it's a completely different story. Understood?[A]

[MidRight]#Wren
Mhmm, but I've bore witness to such things[N]
whenever you and father have taken me to[A][N]
battles. I might not have taken a life myself[N]
yet but I understand what's at stake.[A]

[MidLeft]#Wigbrand
I suppose so, your father and I have never been[N]
ones to hide the truth of war from you. Maybe[A][N]
you're ready after all. I'm confident in your[N]
knowledge of tactical theory but the only way to 
test your leadership abilities is to eventually put[N]
you through the wringer of an actual battle one[A][N]
day.[A]

[MidRight]#Wren
Mhmm, but I've bore witness to such things[N]
whenever you and father have taken me to[A][N]
battles. I might not have taken a life myself[N]
yet but I understand what's at stake.[A]

[MidLeft]#Wigbrand
I wouldn't put too much stock in it, it would take[N]
a mighty fierce leader to unite such a rabble.[A][N]
Perhaps your uncle is overestimating the threat,[N]
he's been thrown into the role of governor for[A][N]
the Hawkport colony suddenly by your[N]
grandfather, Duke Falcone in your father's[A][N]
abscence, he lacks experience. Granted, no one[N]
else would be a fit to take over from your[A][N]
father, wherever he is...[A]

[MidLeft][LoadShamira]
[Left][LoadOrvar]

[MidLeft]#Shamira
Lady Wren! While scouting the area with Huginn[N]
we saw the approach of bandits heading this[A][N]
way! If Orvar hadn't been out in the woods[N]
gathering mushrooms perhaps we'd be able to[A][N]
retrieve my father's gift to Duke Falcone[N]
before they arrived.[A]

[Left]#Orvar
I wasn't looking for mushrooms! I was actually[N]
the only one who thought to scout in the woods[A][N]
you know, bandits could be anywhere! Although[N]
these mushrooms I'm holding right now were just[A][N]
a lucky chance encounter.[A]
[Clear][MidLeft]
[MidLeft][LoadHuginn]

[MidLeft]#Huginn
Save it for later Orvar,[N]
we've got bandits to bash.[A]
[Clear][Left]

[MidRight]#Wigbrand
Aptly put as ever Huginn, seems like you'll be[N]
getting that valuable learning experience much[A][N]  
earlier than anticipated, Lady Wren.[A]

[Right]#Wren
Aye, let's get to it then![A]
[X]

## PrologueReinforcementText

[MidLeft][LoadDatta]
Looks like there's a bunch of sword users[N]
amongst that crowd of knights...[A][N]
No worry, back-up should be coming soon[N]
our sellsword will cut them deep![A][N]
[X]
