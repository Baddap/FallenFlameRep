[MidRight]#Wizvil
Hmph, these knights of Blumari were[N]
easier pickings than I expected. Men![A][N]
Raid the castle from inside and stop[N]
the guards from requesting back-up.[A][N]
We'll kill any hostiles inside and make[N]
off with our gains. I'll stay on guard[A][N]
out here however, in case enemies come.[A]

[MidLeft]#Bandit
Yes sir![A][X]

[MidRight]#Sarai
Ok so, do you think I look cuter with[N]
the red gem bracelet or the blue gem[A][N]
one? The red gem I think suits my[N]
aesthetic more but the blue is a bit[A][N]
more noble, y'know?[A]

[MidLeft]#Dana
Milady, we're due to meet Duke Falcone[N]
in less than five minutes. We seriously[A][N]
need to get a move on. I think our[N]
detour has gone on long enough now...[A]

[MidRight]#Sarai
Fine... We'll make it in five anyway,[N]
it's just a short ride away from here![A][N]
What could possibly delay us further?[A]

[MidLeft]#Dana
Well I think that's your question[N]
answered...[A]

[MidRight]#Sarai
Eek! Dana, slay these impudent fools![N]
How dare they raise their blade against[A][N]
us![A]

[MidLeft]#Dana
Yeah, no. Not on my own. We have to get[N]
reinforcements! Let's go![A]

[MidLeft]#Bandit
Hey! Some soldiers just got past, after[N]
them lads! Don't let any escape![A][X]

[Right]#Wren
Home at last, but no guards standing by.[N]
This unsettles me Wigbrand, something[A]
is amiss.

[MidRight]#Wigbrand
Perhaps the riders approaching over the[N]
horizon will provide some clarity.[A]

[MidLeft][LoadDana]
[Left][LoadSarai]

[Right]#Wren
Dana! Sarai! What's going on? Is it the[N]
bandits and pirates?[A]

[MidLeft]#Dana
Aye! We were setting off from the shop[N]
until we were swarmed by bandits, so[A][N]
we rode out for reinforcements. Seems[N]
like you've came in good time however,[A][N]
their assault on the castle has just[N]
started so we should have enough time[A][N]
seize the front gate back.[A]

[Left]#Sarai
These ruffians have no manners, Wren![N]
We must show them who is really in[A][N]
control here![A]

[Right]#Wren
Oh, you're joining into the fray too?[N]
I didn't know you were eager for combat[A][N]
Sarai, I'm kind of nervous about you[N]
joining but I have faith in you![A]

[Left]#Sarai
Ahaha... uhmm, did I actually say we?[N]
That may've been a slip of the tongue![A]

[MidRight]#Wigbrand
You seem ready enough to join in, with[N]
those lances of yours, let's get to it.[A]

[Left]#Sarai
I mean these are just for my own[N]
protection Wiggy, ahaha...[A]

[MidRight]#Wigbrand
And you're under attack. So use them.[N]
We can't be next to you all the time,[A][N]
the enemy will spread us thin.[A]

[Left]#Sarai
Ughh... fine... How on earth do you put[N]
up with him Wren?[A]

[Right]#Wren
Wigbrand means well, it's no issue.[N]
Let's move out then, I believe in you[A][N]
two![A][X]

## Ch1Wave1Text

[MidLeft][LoadWizvil]
It's no good striking deep into enemy[N]
territory and coming home empty handed[A][N]
if we just idle around. Men, start[N]
moving out from the cave! We have a[A][N]
village to raid.[A]
[X]
