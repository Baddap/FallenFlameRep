[MidLeft]#Dana
Drat... I can't believe I'm fleeing the[N]
castle like a coward! But, if it is the[A][N]
Duke's desire... Come! Hurry up Sarai![N]
We'll have to request back-up.[A]

[Left]#Sarai
Could you... slow down... a bit...?[N]
I'm getting real exhausted out here![A][N]
Riding a pegasus is new to me! I'm not[N]
a trained soldier like you...[A]

[MidLeft]#Dana
Sorry, can't slow down at all, not[N]
while we've got bloodthirsty bandits[A][N]
on our back hounding us down.[A]

[Left]#Sarai
Oh Dana! I think I see one up ahead![N]
His grim face and spiked armour makes[A][N]
me shiver...[A]

[MidLeft]#Dana
That's Wigbrand, Sarai... Looks like[N]
back-up came sooner than I thought![A][N]
Wren's here too! Hey Wren![A]

[Right][LoadWren]
[MidRight][LoadWigbrand]

[Right]#Wren
Sarai! Dana! I'm glad to see you two![N]
What I'm not so glad to see are all the[A][N]
bandits here, it seems my worst fears[N]
were correct, they've taken the castle[A][N]
haven't they?[A]

[MidLeft]#Dana
They're still in the process of seizing[N]
it from within. Meanwhile some of their[A][N]
troops stand guard outside. I think the[N]
Duke isn't in danger if we act swiftly.[A][N]
We should seize the front to ease the[N]
burden of the castle guards inside.[A]

[Left]#Sarai
These ruffians have no manners, Wren![N]
We must show them who is really in[A][N]
control here![A]

[Right]#Wren
Oh, you're joining into the fray too?[N]
I didn't know you were eager for combat[A][N]
Sarai, I'm kind of nervous about you[N]
joining but I have faith in you![A]

[Left]#Sarai
Ahaha... uhmm, did I actually say we?[N]
That may've been a slip of the tongue![A]

[MidRight]#Wigbrand
You seem ready enough to join in, with[N]
those lances of yours, let's get to it.[A]

[Left]#Sarai
I mean these are just for my own[N]
protection Wiggy, ahaha...[A]

[MidRight]#Wigbrand
And you're under attack. So use them.[N]
We can't be next to you all the time,[A][N]
the enemy will spread us thin.[A]

[Left]#Sarai
Ughh... fine... How on earth do you put[N]
up with him Wren?[A]

[Right]#Wren
Wigbrand means well, it's no issue.[N]
Let's move out then, I believe in you[A][N]
two![A]

[MidLeft]#Wren
That's that, the gate is seized so we[N]
can safely press on inside. Looks like[A][N]
the rest of the bandits fled. I hope[N]
granfather is safe...[A]

[MidRight]#Wigbrand
His castle guards are formidable, I[N]
would not be surprised if we'll enter[A][N]
only to find the enemy routed.[A]

[MidRight][LoadWren]
[Right][LoadWigbrand]

[MidRight]#Wren
No bandits inside, looks like you were[N]
right, Wigbrand. Although... there's[A][N]
plenty of blood everywhere... That's[N]
going to stain the tiles for a while.[A]

[Right]#Wigbrand
I believe Duke Falcone is approaching[N]
us, Wren. He looks untouched.[A]

[MidLeft][LoadFalcone]

[MidRight]#Wren
Grandpapa![A]

[MidLeft]#Falcone
Wren! Oh I am relieved to see you! I[N]
can't believe you're on the battlefield[A][N]
already... You've started sooner than I[N]
did... How are you finding it all?[A]

[MidRight]#Wren
It's fine and so am I, grandpapa. Well,[N]
it's not fine but you know what I mean,[A][N]
right?[A]

[MidLeft]#Falcone
No, don't worry, I fully understand.[N]
As long as you, your father and your[A][N]
uncle are fine, I'm fine![A]

[Right]#Wigbrand
Speaking of Sir Kestral, have you heard[N]
any word from him, Duke Falcone?[A]

[MidLeft]#Falcone
Only today did I learn of his status.[N]
A messenger came to me so I could[A][N]
relay a message unto you. Kestral has[N]
departed from the Eastern Viripurian[A][N]
Empire with the princess of its Western[N]
half in his care. Princess Adela is[A][N]
expected to be kept safe within our[N]
capital. However, you're expected to[A][N]
rendezvous with your father at[N]
Aquanpool Port.[A]

[MidRight]#Wren
Why there? Wouldn't it have been easier[N]
for him to head straight for the[A][N]
capital?[A]

[MidLeft]#Falcone
He tried. But they were ambushed at sea[N]
by a particuarly powerful foe so they[A][N]
had to change course.[A]

[MidRight]#Wren
Hmmm, very well. I hope father is safe.[N]
We'll travel by boat to the port from[A][N]
here. Thank you, grandpapa, for the[N]
update. I've been worried sick having[A][N]
no word from father... It'd be nice to[N]
stick around but with these pirates[A][N]
invading I have no time to spare.[N]
Goodbye, grandpapa! I love you![A]

[MidLeft]#Falcone
I love you too Wren![N][A]

[MidRight][ClearFace]

[MidLeft]#Falcone
Tell me, Wigbrand, how does she truly[N]
fare? I cannoy imagine that girl has[A][N]
the fortitude to take a life, I barely[N]
could myself.[A]

[Right]#Wigbrand
She is stronger than you think. Things[N]
normally deemed the domain of men like[A][N]
us such as politics and war are no[N]
stranger to her. They are her lifelong[A][N]
passions.[A]

[MidLeft]#Falcone
Hmph, it is not a state of affairs many[N]
here or in the capital are happy with.[A][N]
But with the situation so dire around[N]
the world, I cannot afford to choose[A][N]
the gender of our commanders freely.[N]
We must take talent regardless of[A][N]
who possesses it. Man or not.[A]

[Right]#Wigbrand
I can vouch for her talent. I have no[N]
doubt that she will prove her worth in[A][N]
battle. Once the inevitable campaign in[N]
Gofaul starts, she will be the best[A][N]
candidate to lead a coalition there.[N]
Gofaul is her second home so to say, I[A][N]
think she's better equipped than others[N]
to gather the allies we need there.[A]

[MidLeft]#Falcone
I suppose there might be a silver[N]
lining in Kestral marrying that wild[A][N]
woman from Gofaul after all...[A]

## Ch1Wave1Text

[MidLeft][LoadWizvil]
It's no good striking deep into enemy[N]
territory and coming home empty handed[A][N]
if we just idle around. Men, start[N]
moving out from the cave! We have a[A][N]
village to raid.[A]
