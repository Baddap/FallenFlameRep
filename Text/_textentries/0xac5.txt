Hmph, these knights of Blumari were[N]
easier pickings than I expected. Men![A][N]
Raid the castle from inside and stop[N]
the guards from requesting back-up.[A][N]
We'll kill any hostiles inside and make[N]
off with our gains. I'll stay on guard[A][N]
out here however, in case enemies come.[A]

Yes sir![A][X]
