[Right]#Wren
Home at last, but no guards standing by.[N]
This unsettles me Wigbrand, something[A]
is amiss.

[MidRight]#Wigbrand
Perhaps the riders approaching over the[N]
horizon will provide some clarity.[A]

[Right]#Wren
Dana! Sarai! What's going on? Is it the[N]
bandits and pirates?[A]

[MidLeft]#Dana
Aye! We were setting off from the shop[N]
until we were swarmed by bandits, so[A][N]
we rode out for reinforcements. Seems[N]
like you've came in good time however,[A][N]
their assault on the castle has just[N]
started so we should have enough time[A][N]
seize the front gate back.[A]

[Left]#Sarai
These ruffians have no manners, Wren![N]
We must show them who is really in[A][N]
control here![A]

[Right]#Wren
Oh, you're joining into the fray too?[N]
I didn't know you were eager for combat[A][N]
Sarai, I'm kind of nervous about you[N]
joining but I have faith in you![A]

[Left]#Sarai
Ahaha... uhmm, did I actually say we?[N]
That may've been a slip of the tongue![A]

[MidRight]#Wigbrand
You seem ready enough to join in, with[N]
those lances of yours, let's get to it.[A]

[Left]#Sarai
I mean these are just for my own[N]
protection Wiggy, ahaha...[A]

[MidRight]#Wigbrand
And you're under attack. So use them.[N]
We can't be next to you all the time,[A][N]
the enemy will spread us thin.[A]

[Left]#Sarai
Ughh... fine... How on earth do you put[N]
up with him Wren?[A]

[Right]#Wren
Wigbrand means well, it's no issue.[N]
Let's move out then, I believe in you[A][N]
two![A][X]
