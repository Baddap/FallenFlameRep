Ok so, do you think I look cuter with[N]
the red gem bracelet or the blue gem[A][N]
one? The red gem I think suits my[N]
aesthetic more but the blue is a bit[A][N]
more noble, y'know?[A]

[MidLeft]#Dana
Milady, we're due to meet Duke Falcone[N]
in less than five minutes. We seriously[A][N]
need to get a move on. I think our[N]
detour has gone on long enough now...[A]

[MidRight]#Sarai
Fine... We'll make it in five anyway,[N]
it's just a short ride away from here![A][N]
What could possibly delay us further?[A]

[MidLeft]#Dana
Well I think that's your question[N]
answered...[A]

[MidRight]#Sarai
Eek! Dana, slay these impudent fools![N]
How dare they raise their blade against[A][N]
us![A]

[MidLeft]#Dana
Yeah, no. Not on my own. We have to get[N]
reinforcements! Let's go![A]
