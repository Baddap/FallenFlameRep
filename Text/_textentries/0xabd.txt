Phew... you took the air out of me there...[N]
Well... good enough for the frontlines now?[A]

[MidLeft]#Wigbrand
A distinct improvement from our last session.[N]
But being ready for the frontlines comes down[A][N]
to more than just being able to fight toe to toe[N]
with trained knights, when the enemy is out for[A][N]
blood and death is abound on the battlefield,[N]
it's a completely different story. Understood?[A]

[MidRight]#Wren
Mhmm, but I've bore witness to such things[N]
whenever you and father have taken me to[A][N]
battles. I might not have taken a life myself[N]
yet but I understand what's at stake.[A]

[MidLeft]#Wigbrand
I suppose so, your father and I have never been[N]
ones to hide the truth of war from you. Maybe[A][N]
you're ready after all. I'm confident in your[N]
knowledge of tactical theory but the only way to 
test your leadership abilities is to eventually put[N]
you through the wringer of an actual battle one[A][N]
day.[A]

[MidLeft]#Wigbrand
I wouldn't put too much stock in it, it would take[N]
a mighty fierce leader to unite such a rabble.[A][N]
Perhaps your uncle is overestimating the threat,[N]
he's been thrown into the role of governor for[A][N]
the Hawkport colony suddenly by your[N]
grandfather, Duke Falcone in your father's[A][N]
abscence, he lacks experience. Granted, no one[N]
else would be a fit to take over from your[A][N]
father, wherever he is...[A]
