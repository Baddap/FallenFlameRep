Lady Wren! While scouting the area with Huginn[N]
we saw the approach of bandits heading this[A][N]
way! If Orvar hadn't been out in the woods[N]
gathering mushrooms perhaps we'd be able to[A][N]
retrieve my father's gift to Duke Falcone[N]
before they arrived.[A]

[Left]#Orvar
I wasn't looking for mushrooms! I was actually[N]
the only one who thought to scout in the woods[A][N]
you know, bandits could be anywhere! Although[N]
these mushrooms I'm holding right now were just[A][N]
a lucky chance encounter.[A]

[MidLeft]#Huginn
Save it for later Orvar,[N]
we've got bandits to bash.[A]

[MidRight]#Wigbrand
Aptly put as ever Huginn, seems like you'll be[N]
getting that valuable learning experience much[A][N]  
earlier than anticipated, Lady Wren.[A]

[Right]#Wren
Aye, let's get to it then![A]
